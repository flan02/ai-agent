# AI AGENT

**Everything we need to know about ai agents.**

## What is an AI agent?

An AI agent is an entity that perceives its environment, takes actions to achieve goals, and learns. It is an autonomous entity that acts, perceives, and learns. It is an entity that can perceive its environment through sensors, take actions to achieve goals, and learn from its experiences. An AI agent can be a software program, a robot, or a human being.

## Capabilities of AI agents

AI agents have the following capabilities:

1. External functionalities
2. Call functions and API's
3. Mimic human behavior

## Types of AI agents

There are different types of AI agents, depending on how they perceive their environment, how they take actions, and how they learn. Some of the common types of AI agents are:

1. Simple reflex agents
2. Model-based reflex agents
3. Goal-based agents
4. Utility-based agents
5. Learning agents

## Simple reflex agents

Simple reflex agents are the simplest type of AI agents. They perceive their environment through sensors and take actions based on predefined rules. They do not have any internal state or memory. They only react to the current state of the environment. They are not capable of learning from their experiences.

## Model-based reflex agents

Model-based reflex agents are more complex than simple reflex agents. They have an internal model of the environment that they use to make decisions. They can take actions based on the current state of the environment and their internal model. They can also learn from their experiences and update their internal model.

## Goal-based agents

Goal-based agents have goals that they want to achieve. They perceive their environment, take actions to achieve their goals, and learn from their experiences. They can plan and reason about their actions to achieve their goals. They can also update their goals based on new information.

## Utility-based agents

Utility-based agents are similar to goal-based agents, but they have a utility function that they use to evaluate the desirability of different states of the environment. They take actions that maximize their expected utility. They can also learn from their experiences and update their utility function.

## Learning agents

Learning agents are the most complex type of AI agents. They can learn from their experiences and improve their performance over time. They can learn from rewards and punishments, and they can learn from feedback from humans. They can also learn by observing other agents.

## Conclusion

AI agents are autonomous entities that perceive their environment, take actions to achieve goals, and learn. There are different types of AI agents, depending on how they perceive their environment, how they take actions, and how they learn. Some of the common types of AI agents are simple reflex agents, model-based reflex agents, goal-based agents, utility-based agents, and learning agents.
